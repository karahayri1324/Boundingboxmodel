## Summary
<img src="./fig/reaper.png" align="right" alt="REAP the experts" width="400">
This repository contains code required to reproduce the expert pruning and merging methods used in the paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13999">REAP the Experts: Why Pruning Prevails for One-Shot MoE compression</a>
<br></br> 
Expert pruning and merging can be used to reduce the memory overhead of Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) LLMs. Our novel expert pruning criterion, Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP) considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms. Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.   
<br></br>

**Our main contributions are as follows:**
- We prove that expert merging introduces *irreducible error* due to the loss of the router's independent, input-dependant modulation of the expert outputs resulting in *functional subspace collapse*, substantially reducing the functional output space of the compressed SMoE layer. In contrast, in expert pruned SMoEs the router maintains independent control over the remaining experts;
- We introduce REAP, a novel expert pruning saliency criterion, which selects experts to prune which contribute minimally to the layer output by considering both the router gate-values and average activation norm of the experts;
- Across diverse SMoE architectures ranging from 20B to 1T parameters and a suite of generative evaluations, we demonstrate the significant and consistent advantage of REAP over existing expert pruning and merging approaches, particularly at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves near-lossless compression on code generation tasks after pruning 50% of experts from Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2.

[REAP model collection on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/cerebras/cerebras-reap), including pruned versions of GLM4.6, GLM4.5-Air, Qwen3-Coder-480B, Qwen3-Coder-30B, MiniMax-M2, Kimi-Linear, DeepSeek-V3.2. More to come, stay tuned!

## Installation

### venv
To build the project and setup a virtual environment install `uv` and run:
```bash
bash scripts/build.sh
```

### Docker
Alternatively, use docker:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose exec app bash
```

The `docker-compose.yaml` file is setup to mount the default huggingface cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`), but if you use a different cache directory then we suggest updating the mount path to avoid excessive container storage sizes.  

### Configuration
Copy `.env.template` and rename as `.env`. Populate the empty fields.

For WildBench, copy `config/wildbench_prod_env_XXXX.example`. Update the copied subdir name with the port used to launch vLLM, defaults to 800X where X is rank of the first GPU used to run the eval script. I.e, `wildbench_prod_env_8000` if running `eval.py` with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3`. In the copied subdir, update `credentials.conf` with your OpenAI API key and in `model_deployments.yaml` substitute `base_url:XXXX` with the port selected. i.e., `http://0.0.0.0:XXXX/v1/ -> http://0.0.0.0:8000/v1/` for the example above. 


### Adding a new model
Add model attribute names to `MODEL_ATTRS` in `src/reap/model_util.py`. Each entry is identified by the class name of the model `model.__class__.__name__` as key. The values correspond to the following:
- `moe_block`: Attribute name of SMoE submodule in the decoder module. 
- `*_proj`: Attribute names for the expert projections. 
- `experts`: Attribute of the ModuleList containing the experts in the SMoE module. 
- `fused`: If true, the model uses a FusedMoE layer. Of the currently supported models, only Llama-4 is fused. 
- `router`: Attribute name of the router/gate layer in the SMoE module. 
- `num_experts`: The key in the huggingface config containing the number of experts per layer. (ie., `num_experts` if `model.config.num_experts` contains this value)
- `num_experts_per_tok`: The key in the huggingface config containing the number of experts activated per token. 


## Reproducing Experiments

### Expert Merging

To run merging experiments, use:

```bash
bash experiments/merging-cli.sh <CUDA_DEVICES> [MODEL_NAME] [MERGE_METHOD] [SEED] [COMPRESSION_RATIO] [DATASET_NAME] [RUN_LM_EVAL] [RUN_EVALPLUS] [RUN_LIVE_CODE_BENCH] [RUN_MATH] [RUN_WILDBENCH] [SINGLETON_SUPER_EXPERTS] [SINGLETON_OUTLIER_EXPERTS]
```

- `CUDA_DEVICES`: e.g. `0` or `0,1`
- `MODEL_NAME`: (default: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B)
- `MERGE_METHOD`: `hc_smoe`, `m_smoe`, or `submoe` (default: hc_smoe)
- `SEED`: (default: 42)
- `COMPRESSION_RATIO`: (default: 0.25)
- `DATASET_NAME`: (default: theblackcat102/evol-codealpaca-v1)
- `RUN_*`: Flags control which evaluations to run (true/false)
- `SINGLETON_SUPER_EXPERTS` and `SINGLETON_OUTLIER_EXPERTS` force super and outlier experts into singleton clusters, respectively. See [Unveiling Super Experts in Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23279) paper for definitions.

Example:
```bash
bash experiments/merging-cli.sh 0 Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B hc_smoe 42 0.25 theblackcat102/evol-codealpaca-v1 true true true false false
```

### Expert Pruning

To run pruning experiments, use:

```bash
bash experiments/pruning-cli.sh <CUDA_DEVICES> [MODEL_NAME] [PRUNING_METHOD] [SEED] [COMPRESSION_RATIO] [DATASET_NAME] [RUN_LM_EVAL] [RUN_EVALPLUS] [RUN_LIVE_CODE_BENCH] [RUN_MATH] [RUN_WILDBENCH] [SINGLETON_SUPER_EXPERTS] [SINGLETON_OUTLIER_EXPERTS]
```

- `PRUNING_METHOD`: e.g. `reap` will use the REAP expert saliency criterion for expert pruning. 
- Other arguments are similar to merging.

Example:
```bash
bash experiments/pruning-cli.sh 0 Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B frequency 42 0.25 theblackcat102/evol-codealpaca-v1 true true true false false
```
